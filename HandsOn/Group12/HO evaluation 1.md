    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - The resource naming strategy is not complete.
    Ontology
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
    RDF data
        - The RDF data has not been delivered.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
