## Comments on the self-assessment
Following the events of our fourth assessment, we would like to clarify that we uploaded only a sample of the output as "output-with-links.nt" due to the file size being too large for Git versioning. Additionally, we mistakenly referred to "output.nt" as "output.ttl" in our previous assessment. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused during the review process.
