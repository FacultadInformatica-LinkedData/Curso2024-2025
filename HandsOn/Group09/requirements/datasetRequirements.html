    <h1>Dataset Requirements Analysis: Concesiones y Autorizaciones 2023</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This document analyzes how the selected dataset on concessions and authorizations in 2023 satisfies the established requirements for the assignment.
    </p>

    <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Dataset name:</strong> Concesiones y Autorizaciones 2023<br>
        <strong>Source:</strong> Group-provided dataset<br>
        <strong>Description:</strong> This dataset contains information on the concessions and authorizations granted across various sectors during 2023, such as "INSTALACIONES DE RESTAURACIÓN" and "OTRAS CONCESIONES Y AUTORIZACIONES".
    </p>

    <h2>Requirement Analysis</h2>

    <h3>R1: Smart City Domain</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset is highly relevant to the **smart city domain**, particularly in urban governance and public administration. The issuance of authorizations and concessions plays a critical role in managing public spaces and services, which are key areas in smart city initiatives.
    </p>

    <h3>R2: CSV Format</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset is available in **CSV format**, allowing for easy processing, transformation into RDF, and linking with other datasets. CSV is a widely supported format that is ideal for open data publication.
    </p>

    <h3>R3: Open License</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset must be published under an **open license**, which allows it to be freely reused and published. This ensures compliance with open data usage requirements. However, the specific license needs to be confirmed.
    </p>

    <h3>R4: Linkage to Real-World Entities</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset includes real-world data on concessions and authorizations linked to specific locations and sectors within the city, such as "Distrito" and "Situación". This makes it easy to link the dataset with other urban administrative and geographic datasets.
    </p>

    <h3>Optional Requirement R5: Documentation</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset lacks detailed documentation, which makes it harder to fully understand its structure and fields. Therefore, this optional requirement is only partially satisfied.
    </p>

    <h3>Optional Requirement R6: Multiple Data Sources</h3>
    <p>
        The data comes from a single source. Therefore, this optional requirement is not met, as there are no multiple data sources contributing to the dataset.
