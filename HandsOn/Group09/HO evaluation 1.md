        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
    Ontology
        - The ontology presents serialization issues; is not a valid Turtle file. Do not create ontologies by hand; use some tool.
    RDF data
        - Object properties are used with strings.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
